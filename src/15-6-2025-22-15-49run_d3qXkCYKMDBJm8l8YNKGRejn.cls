Here is the corrected version of your test class, with adjustments based on Salesforce coding best practices and the recommendations of the Salesforce Code Analyzer:

```apex
@IsTest
private class SumTest {

    @IsTest
    static void testSumOfTwoParameters() {
        Integer a = 5;
        Integer b = 10;
        Integer expectedSum = 15;

        Integer result = add(a, b);

        // Using the Assert class to validate the result
        assertEquals(expectedSum, result, 'Sum of 5 and 10 should be 15');
    }

    // Helper method to perform the addition
    private static Integer add(Integer num1, Integer num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

### Corrections Made:
1. **Removal of System Namespace**: In the assert statement, the prefix `System` was removed since the `Assert` namespace does not require it for methods like `assertEquals` .

2. **Method Name in Asserts**: Confirm the correct method in the `Assert` class is used. This case uses `assertEquals` rather than `areEqual`, as `assertEquals` is the more current recommendation .

3. **Use of Annotations**: The use of `@IsTest` is proper, following the suggestion that it be consistently used with test methods and classes .

This refactor aligns with the current documentation on the use of `Assert` methods and proper practices for Salesforce test classes. Make sure that your Salesforce environment is aligned with these guidelines to ensure verification aligns with the Salesforce platform's best practices.
