Let's adjust the test class based on best practices and the feedback from the Salesforce Code Analyzer. Here are some considerations and improvements based on the documentation:

1. Ensure that the test class does not share state between test methods, which could lead to unexpected results.
2. Use `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` if the test involves any asynchronous operations or governor limits.
3. Make sure assertions are used correctly without the `System` namespace prefix, and that error messages are clear.
4. Ensure that all methods used in tests are properly defined and that logic encapsulation is clear.

Here is the potentially improved version of your `AdditionTest` class based on common best practices:

```apex
@IsTest
private class AdditionTest {

    // Test method to ensure the addition is working as expected
    @IsTest
    static void testAddition() {
        // Arrange
        Integer num1 = 5;
        Integer num2 = 10;
        
        // Act
        Integer result = addNumbers(num1, num2);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.areEqual(15, result, 'The sum of 5 and 10 should be 15');
    }
    
    // Private helper method to add two numbers
    private static Integer addNumbers(Integer a, Integer b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

**Notes:**
- The `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` methods are not needed here since there are no asynchronous calls or heavy limits usage to be reset between test execution.
- Ensure that the method `addNumbers` is only used within the test class context as it is declared private.
- The `Assert` class methods like `Assert.areEqual` should not use the `System` prefix【4:0†source】. 

This revised class should follow more closely the pattern of modern Apex testing as advised by Salesforce best practices. If there are any specific suggestions from the Salesforce Code Analyzer, please adjust the class accordingly to resolve those errors too.
