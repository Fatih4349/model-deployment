To address the issues highlighted by Salesforce Code Analyzer, the test class needs to be adjusted for compliance with best practices in Apex. Based on the review of Salesforce documentation, here's the corrected version of the test class:

```apex
@IsTest
private class AdditionTest {

    // This method is marked as a test method to be recognized by the testing framework
    @IsTest
    static void testAddition() {
        // Arrange
        Integer a = 5;
        Integer b = 7;
        
        // Act
        Integer result = a + b;
        
        // Assert using the newer assertion methods without the System prefix.
        Assert.areEqual(12, result, 'Expected sum of 5 and 7 is 12');
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Annotation**: The class and method should be annotated with `@IsTest`. This indicates that they are used for testing purposes only and do not count against your org's code size limit【4:3†source】.

2. **Assertions**: While there were no syntax issues with the `Assert.areEqual` statement in your code, it is crucial to note that assertions in newer Apex code should be formatted without the `System` prefix. Ensure your testing asserts are compatible with the current Salesforce Apex standards  .

3. **Best Practices**: The structure and logic of your test case (i.e., having Arrange, Act, Assert) conform to best practices for writing clear and maintainable test methods. Additionally, ensure every test method methodically tests specific functionality .

This revised version should be aligned with Salesforce best practices, ensuring better compliance with code quality checks. If further adjustments are necessary for specific analyzer feedback or errors, more contextual detail might be needed to fine-tune the code.
