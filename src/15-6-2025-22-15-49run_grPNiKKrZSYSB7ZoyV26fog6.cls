Based on the Salesforce Apex reference guide and developer guide, it appears that the primary issue with your existing test class is related to the use of assertions and possibly the need for setting up test data correctly. Let's adjust the code accordingly:

1. **Correct Assertion Usage**: Ensure you use the basic format for assertions correctly. Use the `assertEquals` method without the `System` namespace as you've already imported it.

2. **Isolation of Test Data**: Currently, the test method's logic for data management seems fine, but ensure that your test data isn't reliant on existing organization data unless explicitly necessary and safe.

Here's the revised code:

```apex
@IsTest
private class AdditionTest {

    @IsTest
    static void testAddition() {
        // Arrange
        Integer a = 5;
        Integer b = 10;
        Integer expectedSum = 15;

        // Act
        Integer actualSum = a + b;

        // Assert
        Assert.areEqual(expectedSum, actualSum, 'The sum of the two numbers should be 15.');
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- **Assertions**: Use `Assert.areEqual` rather than `System.assert`. Assertions are a crucial part of testing to ensure that your logic is performing as expected .
- **Isolation**: It's a best practice to use data created within the test method unless there is a need to access existing org data explicitly, which can be done using `@IsTest(SeeAllData = true)` . This approach helps in maintaining data integrity across tests.
- **Documentation**: Always ensure your code is documented and follows the annotations and practices as documented in the developer guide, which aids in maintenance and scalability .

Ensure you follow these guidelines for a more robust and maintainable test suite.
